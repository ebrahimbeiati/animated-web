## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure Node.js is installed on your system. Use version 14 or newer for compatibility.

### Steps
1. **Clone or Fork**  
   Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash

   cd animated-web
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install required packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start Development Server**  
   Begin development with:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

4. **Build for Production**  
   Create a production-ready build:
   ```bash
