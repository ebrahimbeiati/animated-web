# React + Vite Template

This project template provides a minimal and efficient setup for using React with Vite, enabling features like Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and a basic set of ESLint rules to improve code quality.

## Features

- **React with Vite**: A fast, modern build tool with a focus on speed and performance.
- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Instantly reflect changes in your React application without full reloads, making the development experience smoother.
- **ESLint Integration**: Default ESLint rules to maintain code consistency and quality across your project.

## Available Plugins

Currently, there are two official plugins to choose from, each providing Fast Refresh:

1. **[@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md)**
   - Uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
   - Ideal for those who prefer Babel's ecosystem and plugin support.

2. **[@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)**
   - Uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.
   - Suitable for users who want better performance, especially for large codebases, as SWC is faster than Babel.

## Getting Started

To get started with this template, clone or fork the repository, then follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start Development Server**  
   Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server with:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start Vite's development server, and you should be able to access your app at `http://localhost:5173`.

3. **Build the Project**  
   To create a production build, use:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This will bundle your application for production, optimizing it for performance.

## Configuration

You can customize this template by modifying the following files:

- **`vite.config.ts`**: Configure Vite-specific settings.
- **`.eslintrc.js`**: Modify ESLint rules as per your teamâ€™s coding standards.
